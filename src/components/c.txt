                  Hi, I'm Chathura, a passionate web developer with expertise in
                  front-end technologies. I love building beautiful and
                  user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My
                  goal is to create engaging digital experiences that leave a
                  lasting impression on users.

                  With a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving, I am
                  always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. I believe
                  in continuous improvement and strive to write clean,
                  efficient, and maintainable code. I enjoy collaborating with
                  teams to bring ideas to life and contribute to impactful
                  projects.

                  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest web
                  development trends, reading tech blogs, or playing video
                  games. I'm also an avid traveler and love capturing moments
                  through photography.
